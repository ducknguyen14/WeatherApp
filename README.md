# CloudCoverApp

***********************************************
********* Welcome to my Cloud Cover App!! *********
***********************************************

This application tells users what the weather is in any given city.
WeatherApp was my first exposure to using APIs. It allowed me to have an overview learning of how to fetch the weather data from OpenWeatherMap
using API requests.

Make sure to type the city correctly, there is no spell check feature impelemented yet.
